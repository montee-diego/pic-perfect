## Objective

A simple site to search and save images powered by [Pexels](https://pexels.com/) API. It uses no
frameworks or libraries, it is all written in vanilla JS. The main objective of this project
is to learn and build a site with infinite scrolling and working with local storage.

## Technical Overview

- Infinite scrolling.
- Handling of collections and loved photos in local storage.
- API calls in vanilla JS using fetch.
- Animated placeholders while images are loading.

## Compatibility

- Tested on desktop: Firefox, Chrome and Edge
- Tested on mobile: Firefox, Chrome

## Comments

User data (collections and loved photos) is saved in local storage, which means it is accessible
only on the device in use when interacting with the page, if I were to implement a CMS and user
login, I would probably migrate the whole thing to a framework to make the project easier to update
and maintain.
